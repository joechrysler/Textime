#Time is precious
Don't waste it tracking itself.

textime.rb parses a simple text file of in and out timepoints into yet another plaintext report indicating how many hours you work each day, each week
and how many you have left to go (useful for hourly workers on flexible schedules).

Follow the input format in sample.txt, 3 day weeks are the default for now. And call it like this: "ruby textime.rb sample.txt".  Output is stdout.

It's a quick hack, but it works.
